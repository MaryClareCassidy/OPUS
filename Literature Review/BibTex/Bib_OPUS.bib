annotate={They designed an optically powered unmanned system with a MAV, powerful IR laser, and photovoltaic cell. The system demonstrated long-term flight (approx. 12 and a half hours) within a 5 by 5 meter cube. This proved that long-term flight is possible with laser power. It is important to try replicating these results but to a smaller scale. If anything, we can prove the same thing with poorer equipment/conditions as a testament to the technology’s accessibility.}

annotate = {This work was a confirmation of basic practices used among UAVs. It reaffirmed the general practice of leveraging on-board IMUs and altitude sensors (pressure perhaps) to control flight. Although we will likely use a quadcopter, we would like to transmit controls through a light beam in contrast to a RF beam. By avoiding RF transmissions, our transmissions could avoid the danger of RF jammers.}

  annotate    = {In this paper, methods of improving of efficiency of laser power beaming are examined. An example of a solar cell that is able to handle the intensity of laser power beaming is the vertical multi-junction (VMJ) solar cell it is most efficient in the 900-1000nm wavelengths and can provide up to 20 percent conversion efficiency. The performance decreases with temperature so a heat sink is needed. Conversion efficiency begins dropping dramatically at temperatures over 60°C. The optimal wavelength for laser energy is 976nm. Attempting to match the PV cell geometry to the gaussian beam increased efficiency. }

The gaussian beam profile of lasers lowers the efficiency of the PV cells because of the distribution of intensity. There are ways to combat this that will improve efficiency if once there is a working model of the system. The best PV receiver geometry for the purposes of this system would be a sawtooth geometry as it has lowest manufacturing cost and is most forgiving is beam accuracy.

The laser used is this experiment was capable of up to 10 W output and the receiver was only producing 1.3W of power at the end so the efficiency is not that high. The photovoltaic cell heated up very quickly. The bare cell could only operate for 5 seconds. The final design of the receiver used an aluminum heatsink with fins. There was a large amount of thermal energy being wasted. A thermoelectric generator (TEG) allows some of that energy to be harvested. With both the heatsink and thermoelectric generator, the system was able to output 1.3W for 8 hours.}

Copper transfer is a path for lightning that can produce power surges or voltage spikes. This is bad when dealing with munitions as it could ingnite them. This piece discusses the biggest issue with power beaming is that it does not transfer energy well enought. Discusses issues with PV cell power density ability to take the laser. The efficiency of the PV cell is the biggest issue. Look at the VMJ PV cell. }
